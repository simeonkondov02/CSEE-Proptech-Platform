                          <br>
                          Founded in 2017, we are a real estate company changing how people buy, sell and rent homes. We are disrupting the real estate market by building
                          a seamless digital customer experience while creating cutting-edge technology for our agents, making buying and selling homes fast, simple, and safe.

                          In addition to offering a top-notch customer experience and developing technology, sustainability is one of the cornerstones of our operations.
                          That’s why our in-house purchasing and renovation teams make sure old homes get a second chance.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                          One of our main objectives is to make homeownership more accessible, which is why we acquired the Spanish Real Estate startup Lucas in 2021. It
                          s the first time an iBuyer and a Rent-to-Own company have been merged to providing more flexibility for first home buyers. With our revolutionary
                          Rent-to-Own service, you can rent your dream home for a year while we help you save for a down payment. With Kodit Pay, anyone can become a
                          homeowner without years of saving.

                          We are a team of over 200 across 6 offices in Finland, Spain, and Poland. We have helped thousands of home sellers and buyers, thanks to our team
                          of specialists who work every day with technology and data to guarantee efficiency and peace of mind in each transaction. Though the work is far
                          from over. We have ambitious expansion plans for our new markets and new models in the rear-view.

                        <p class="paragraph">

                          I started my career in TV producing for a leading regional production house in Sofia, Bulgaria. I then made the move to a small
                          boutique studio working on short and feature-length Advertising. Since the last 5 years my battlefield became Advertising. I now
                          manage a creative collective that specializes into VR & AR projects. We have more than 150 projects in our portfolio, including:
                          The First Bulgarian 360-degrees Music Video, Our Own VR Headsets, The First BTL Campaign with Stereoscopic Virtual Reality, etc.
                          Also, I am a co-founder of Vericco - a virtual tour production company that produces some of the best quality virtual tours.

                                Chiara Tagliaro investigates digitalization and new ways of working and their impacts on people and the built environment. Her cross Atlantic experiences
                                allowed her to increase the awareness and impact of her research in both real estate theory and practice. She works as a post-doc researcher at Politecnico

                                Chiara will share the results of the Italian PropTech Monitor, a study that the Italian PropTech Network – IPN (within the Real Estate Center of Politecnico
                                di Milano) conducts yearly since 2018 to keep track of the PropTech expansion in the country and abroad. The Monitor shows how PropTech is gaining momentum in
                                Italy, even if with some delay compared to other European counterparts. At the same time, the Monitor demonstrates some of the strengths and weaknesses of the
                                PropTech national ecosystem. The activities and events organized by the IPN aim at addressing the most urgent issues that are slowing down the PropTech development.
                                However, a lot of work still needs be done, especially to internationalize the local real estate investments and operations.

                                Since the onset of the pandemic schools and businesses have struggled to offer safe spaces for people to gather and work collectively.

                                Ventilation is proven to be one of, if not the best measure to prevent virus transmission indoors. However, occupancy and ventilation
                                characteristics differ in each room so it's difficult to know when to ventilate, and for how long, to keep the air safe.

                                RYSTA Protect, our CO2 traffic light and air quality monitor, helps schools and businesses ventilate optimally to improve air quality and reduce virus
                                transmission risk. This creates a healthy working environment fostering inner peace, better concentration and promotes a sense of community.

                                By alerting room occupants to air quality through the CO2 traffic light, RYSTA Protect helps people to ventilate optimally. This offers several benefits:<br>
                                •	Certainty that schools and businesses are offering safe working spaces and that they can remain open<br>
                                • Peace of mind for room occupants so they can work and learn collectively carefree<br>
                                •	Reduced heat loss through optimally adjusted ventilation<br>
                                • Good indoor air promoting concentration and counteracting allergies and illnesses<br>

                                Our in-house developed IoT platform features sensors, analytics and frontends. Each sensor measures CO2 concentration, temperature, humidity, noise, brightness
                                and pressure. This data gives us transparency into our buildings and can be used to understand room occupancy, reduce mould risk, reduce energy consumption and
                                more.

                                Data is at the heart of what RYSTA does. Since each sensor measures 6 metrics, we can measure as many metrics and data points that are feasible for each customer.
                                Additionally, our adaptable platform can be tailored to many use cases.

                                RYSTA is designed to monitor entire buildings rather than covering single rooms. Customers can see data from across all their rooms through the dashboard. Data
                                sets for learning and improving services can also be made available to third parties such as insurance and utility companies.

                                • Teachers and pupils jointly take responsibility for when to ventilate - creating a sense of community and helping fearful kids because they don’t have to
                                rely on the teacher who might be too busy teaching in order to pay attention all the time<br>
                                •	RYSTA helps that there is clarity (and no arguing) for exactly how long windows need to stay open<br>
                                • They learned that the outside weather, class size and age of the pupils matter a lot; they also learned about the importance of cross airing<br>
                                •	The dashboard gives additional insights previously unknown (e.g. heating/cooling behaviour of a room/building throughout day/night, room occupancy)<br>
                                • The wall-mounted traffic light sensor is discreet yet clear with only visual and no acoustic alerts for uninterrupted teaching, specifically designed for
                                learning and working environments

                                Adam Korbuly is the key founder of OrthoGraph. Adam is an Electrical Engineer by profession, but worked always as a software developer from the age of 12. As an
                                employee of Graphisoft in 1998 invented ArchiFM, the first BIM CAFM and CMMS software system (at that time BIM was called Virtual Building). This system became
                                the market leader in Hungary and is used all around the world with success. In 2005 Adam made a spin-off of the ArchiFM department and established an own company
                                that has grown continuously since then.
                            </p>

                            <p class="paragraph">
                                During project implementations that Adam personally participated in it became clear that one of the strongest pain points of each individual system implementation
                                is the lack of valid building data. Neither the floor plans, nor the asset inventory are valid at typical projects, even if they exist at any level. That's what
                                brought Adam with his friend to establish OrthoGraph as a mobile and web technology focusing on democratizing the BIM Digital Twin for facility and maintenance
                                management services.

                                Adam still participates in sales, project services, technology developments related to the project implementation to be able to effectively fulfill the growing demand
                                for OrthoGraph's services by involving a continuously growing service and strategic development partner network.

                                facility management costs by digitizing property data and operation workflows with low-cost, accurate as-built survey technology, run by your maintenance crew, all
                                integrated.

                                OrthoGraph is already used by Hospitals (e.g. largest Hospital-University in Hungary - Semmelweis University), Universities (e.g. University of Public Service, Széchenyi
                                István University), construction companies (e.g. Futureal), production companies (e.g. in BOSCH's largest production plant) and many other modern thinking large property
                                owners, who understand the importance of increasing the performance of building operation while reducing their related costs.

                                / surveyor and 500-700 inventory items daily per surveyor, and this can be multiplied by the number of surveyors.

                                OrthoGraph is an integrated system that can support any kind of CAFM, CMMS, BMS or any system that needs access to the live building data - let it be a datasource or to
                                provide graphical access to it in 2D or 3D. The system already has integrations with Planon and ArchiFM as leading BIM IWMS software solutions.

                                </span><br>
                                OrthoGraph is mainly a technology provider to support building surveying, inventory and operation services in an integration with third-party technologies. OrthoGraph
                                directly only participates in pilot projects of system implementations, and then hands over the full projects to their local and global partners. OrthoGraph Enterprise
                                technology has been used in several successful projects at the largest property owners, hospitals, universities, shopping malls, office houses and production facilities.
                                At all of these projects removing the long lasting entry-barrier of reality capture by using simple and rugged tools and workflows ensured instant ROIs of all project
                                costs for the end-users and a strong base for scaling up the results to the total properties.
                            </p>

                            <p class="paragraph">
                                OrthoGraph technology is available worldwide either supported by the continuously growing international partner network of OrthoGraph or served directly with the strength
                                of the company's HQ resources. OrthoGraph is looking for international partners that can provide local services related to reality capture, CAFM consultation, business
                                process reengineering and local training services. The model is beneficial for all participants of the chain including most importantly the end-users, who can expect a 3-6
                                times ROI for the first year of implementation, and a 15 times ROI for 3 years of system implementation and usage. This is achieved by accurate surface and inventory data
                                for rental, refurbishment/renovation, maintenance and regular operation services of any kinds of buildings. Interestingly in the era of industrial use the BIM generated by
                                the CAFM services can be further used to support the machinery maintenance, greatly reducing the downtimes and repair times of production equipment. This means the facility
                                management services provide well visible value generation in the effective production performance of such companies.

                                In response to COVID-19 OrthoGraph contains a new feature that helps planning the arrangement of offices, workplaces by graphically displaying if they are too close to
                                each-other. This simplifies the graphical planning of the arrangements keeping social distancing, all-this on-site where the particular utilization of such arrangements should
                                be applied.

                      <b>The reason to undertake making these maps is very simple:</b> when we tried to figure out how Eastern Europe is being positioned on
                      international level in PropTech, we found no information in one place which explicitly and clearly displays the big picture, particularly
                      the number of PropTech companies in different geographical regions; which are the most dominant continents in PropTech (based on nr of
                      generated tech solutions); how different European regions differ when compared to each other, and most importantly what the position of
                      Eastern Europe is.

              Annually, PropTech Bulgaria issues BULGARIA: PropTech Mapping Report, in order to position in the most precise way the country internationally. We
              believe that it is absolutely impossible to position a country without proper information and steady research on an annual basis. BULGARIA: PropTech
              Mapping Reports contain high-end market expertise, contacts with high-potential PropTechs, industry trends analyses, etc.<br>

              We are proud that Bulgaria is among the first few countries with such extensive PropTech Mapping Reports. The edition on Bulgaria has been released
              for 4 consecutive years now. This fact ranks us among the forerunners in the research approach to international PropTech development of countries
              and we are glad to be a vital inspiration to many other European countries to issue such reports. See 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 editions below.<br>

                The Report contains a PropTech profile per each of the 30 European countries arranged in an alphabetical order. The profile format is unified, thus making
                it easy for anyone to get an idea about a country and compare countries, as well as the 6 European geographic regions (CSEE, DACH, Nordics, South Europe,
                BeNeLux & France, UK & Ireland).<br>

                This Report is build on the understanding that each country has its own specific PropTech profile, thus making it strong in some areas; depicting the free
                market niches; showcasing the outstanding PropTech solution types one can find in this country.<br>

                We believe that such information will facilitates tremendously the crossborder Business Development opportunities for PropTechs in Europe.
