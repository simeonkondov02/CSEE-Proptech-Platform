                          <span style="font-weight: bold">About the company:</span>
                          <br>
                          Founded in 2017, we are a real estate company changing how people buy, sell and rent homes. We are disrupting the real estate market by building
                          a seamless digital customer experience while creating cutting-edge technology for our agents, making buying and selling homes fast, simple, and safe.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                          In addition to offering a top-notch customer experience and developing technology, sustainability is one of the cornerstones of our operations.
                          That’s why our in-house purchasing and renovation teams make sure old homes get a second chance.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                          One of our main objectives is to make homeownership more accessible, which is why we acquired the Spanish Real Estate startup Lucas in 2021. It
                          s the first time an iBuyer and a Rent-to-Own company have been merged to providing more flexibility for first home buyers. With our revolutionary
                          Rent-to-Own service, you can rent your dream home for a year while we help you save for a down payment. With Kodit Pay, anyone can become a
                          homeowner without years of saving.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                          We are a team of over 200 across 6 offices in Finland, Spain, and Poland. We have helped thousands of home sellers and buyers, thanks to our team
                          of specialists who work every day with technology and data to guarantee efficiency and peace of mind in each transaction. Though the work is far
                          from over. We have ambitious expansion plans for our new markets and new models in the rear-view.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                          Changing the way the industry works takes persistence, hard work, and dedication – which is why we have put together a team filled with the
                          industry’s most innovative problem-solvers and doers. We move fast, take risks, welcome bold ideas and own our decisions as we reimagine the
                          future of Real Estate.

                            After completing my MSc and BSc studies in civil engineering in Vienna, I worked with prominent Austrian and Swiss contractors and developers.

                            Austrian-Swiss construction group and Russian Railways. Among other managerial tasks, I enabled entering new markets and product
