                            Chiara Tagliaro investigates digitalization and new ways of working and their impacts on people and the built environment. Her cross Atlantic experiences
                            allowed her to increase the awareness and impact of her research in both real estate theory and practice. She works as a post-doc researcher at Politecnico
                            di Milano within the Real Estate Center, where she is currently responsible for a few research and consultancy activities, including the coordination of the
                            Italian PropTech Network. She aims at developing new strategies and innovative technologies to drive workers, organizations, and cities toward a more sustainable
                            future.

                            Chiara will share the results of the Italian PropTech Monitor, a study that the Italian PropTech Network – IPN (within the Real Estate Center of Politecnico
                            di Milano) conducts yearly since 2018 to keep track of the PropTech expansion in the country and abroad. The Monitor shows how PropTech is gaining momentum in
                            Italy, even if with some delay compared to other European counterparts. At the same time, the Monitor demonstrates some of the strengths and weaknesses of the
                            PropTech national ecosystem. The activities and events organized by the IPN aim at addressing the most urgent issues that are slowing down the PropTech development.
                            However, a lot of work still needs be done, especially to internationalize the local real estate investments and operations.

                            In late 2016, blackprint Booster was initiated as the first continental European PropTech Accelerator to support innovative business models in
                            the real estate industry. The company is located in Frankfurt am Main, Germany and has a total of 18 alumni teams, making it one of the most
                            significant early-stage PropTech investors in the world. Since then, blackprint Booster has established itself as the go-to-place for PropTech
                            in Germany. As a network platform, blackprint Booster connects PropTech companies, established corporates and venture capitalists in order to
                            drive digitization, innovation and sustainability for the construction & real estate industry.

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Since the onset of the pandemic schools and businesses have struggled to offer safe spaces for people to gather and work collectively.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Ventilation is proven to be one of, if not the best measure to prevent virus transmission indoors. However, occupancy and ventilation
                            characteristics differ in each room so it's difficult to know when to ventilate, and for how long, to keep the air safe.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            RYSTA Protect, our CO2 traffic light and air quality monitor, helps schools and businesses ventilate optimally to improve air quality and reduce virus
                            transmission risk. This creates a healthy working environment fostering inner peace, better concentration and promotes a sense of community.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            By alerting room occupants to air quality through the CO2 traffic light, RYSTA Protect helps people to ventilate optimally. This offers several benefits:<br>
                            •	Certainty that schools and businesses are offering safe working spaces and that they can remain open<br>
                            • Peace of mind for room occupants so they can work and learn collectively carefree<br>
                            •	Reduced heat loss through optimally adjusted ventilation<br>
                            • Good indoor air promoting concentration and counteracting allergies and illnesses<br>
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Our in-house developed IoT platform features sensors, analytics and frontends. Each sensor measures CO2 concentration, temperature, humidity, noise, brightness
                            and pressure. This data gives us transparency into our buildings and can be used to understand room occupancy, reduce mould risk, reduce energy consumption and
                            more.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Data is at the heart of what RYSTA does. Since each sensor measures 6 metrics, we can measure as many metrics and data points that are feasible for each customer.
                            Additionally, our adaptable platform can be tailored to many use cases.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            RYSTA is designed to monitor entire buildings rather than covering single rooms. Customers can see data from across all their rooms through the dashboard. Data
                            sets for learning and improving services can also be made available to third parties such as insurance and utility companies.

                            At this stage,  schools (in Germany) are primarily using the solution - from kindergarten to secondary schools.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Our customers tell us that:<br>
                            • Teachers and pupils jointly take responsibility for when to ventilate - creating a sense of community and helping fearful kids because they don’t have to
                            rely on the teacher who might be too busy teaching in order to pay attention all the time<br>
                            •	RYSTA helps that there is clarity (and no arguing) for exactly how long windows need to stay open<br>
                            • They learned that the outside weather, class size and age of the pupils matter a lot; they also learned about the importance of cross airing<br>
                            •	The dashboard gives additional insights previously unknown (e.g. heating/cooling behaviour of a room/building throughout day/night, room occupancy)<br>
                            • The wall-mounted traffic light sensor is discreet yet clear with only visual and no acoustic alerts for uninterrupted teaching, specifically designed for
                            learning and working environments
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            RYSTA is also being used for room climate monitoring in server rooms in Australia, through our in-market partner

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Adam Korbuly is the key founder of OrthoGraph. Adam is an Electrical Engineer by profession, but worked always as a software developer from the age of 12. As an
                            employee of Graphisoft in 1998 invented ArchiFM, the first BIM CAFM and CMMS software system (at that time BIM was called Virtual Building). This system became
                            the market leader in Hungary and is used all around the world with success. In 2005 Adam made a spin-off of the ArchiFM department and established an own company
                            that has grown continuously since then.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            During project implementations that Adam personally participated in it became clear that one of the strongest pain points of each individual system implementation
                            is the lack of valid building data. Neither the floor plans, nor the asset inventory are valid at typical projects, even if they exist at any level. That's what
                            brought Adam with his friend to establish OrthoGraph as a mobile and web technology focusing on democratizing the BIM Digital Twin for facility and maintenance
                            management services.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Adam still participates in sales, project services, technology developments related to the project implementation to be able to effectively fulfill the growing demand
                            for OrthoGraph's services by involving a continuously growing service and strategic development partner network.

                            Many CAFM+CMMS projects fail before their start due to the high entry barrier of collecting digital building data and the high cost of keeping that data up to date.

                                Info on buildings/projects OrthoGraph operates in what kind of issues OrthoGraph solves, especially ones related to Covid-19
                            </span><br>
                            OrthoGraph is mainly a technology provider to support building surveying, inventory and operation services in an integration with third-party technologies. OrthoGraph
                            directly only participates in pilot projects of system implementations, and then hands over the full projects to their local and global partners. OrthoGraph Enterprise
                            technology has been used in several successful projects at the largest property owners, hospitals, universities, shopping malls, office houses and production facilities.
                            At all of these projects removing the long lasting entry-barrier of reality capture by using simple and rugged tools and workflows ensured instant ROIs of all project
                            costs for the end-users and a strong base for scaling up the results to the total properties.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            OrthoGraph technology is available worldwide either supported by the continuously growing international partner network of OrthoGraph or served directly with the strength
                            of the company's HQ resources. OrthoGraph is looking for international partners that can provide local services related to reality capture, CAFM consultation, business
                            process reengineering and local training services. The model is beneficial for all participants of the chain including most importantly the end-users, who can expect a 3-6
                            times ROI for the first year of implementation, and a 15 times ROI for 3 years of system implementation and usage. This is achieved by accurate surface and inventory data
                            for rental, refurbishment/renovation, maintenance and regular operation services of any kinds of buildings. Interestingly in the era of industrial use the BIM generated by
                            the CAFM services can be further used to support the machinery maintenance, greatly reducing the downtimes and repair times of production equipment. This means the facility
                            management services provide well visible value generation in the effective production performance of such companies.
                        </p>

                            In response to COVID-19 OrthoGraph contains a new feature that helps planning the arrangement of offices, workplaces by graphically displaying if they are too close to
                            each-other. This simplifies the graphical planning of the arrangements keeping social distancing, all-this on-site where the particular utilization of such arrangements should
                            be applied.

                            multidisciplinary and international teams. He worked as innovation consultant and leading new business units from 2011 until 2016, when Cubelizer was born. At
                            CUBELIZER, he is leading the business side and general management of the company.

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Celso is a strategic and creative thinker, goal-oriented person, and a natural relationship builder, always open to grab a coffee to talk, listen, learn, and share.

                            As customers and users of retail stores and shopping centers, Marcos and Celso, wondered how these spaces were being managed. A great gap was identified, and a lack
                            of data to manage them in a more efficient way. While analytics were a key tool in the digital world, physical world, and specifically in the retail sector, lacked,
                            and still did, accurate, consistent, and reliable data about space people behavior. Even more, a rising concern about privacy became a stone on the road for many
                            solutions without a clear path to solve it. So, CUBELIZER was born to provide physical assets the tool they needed to manage spaces in an actual informed way.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            CUBELIZER was born in 2016 from the vision of creating a new era of highly efficient management of physical assets by providing actual and real time information
                            about how spaces are really used while respecting people's privacy. We aim to automate and make easy getting information about how spaces perform.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            CUBELIZER helps physical space managers and designers, especially shopping centers and workplaces, understand the use of the space to improve design and operation,
                            getting higher efficiency and revenues and savings. We use accurate and consistent information gathered in an anonymous way from our in-house developed real time image
                            processing solution.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Physical spaces are in urgent need of data-driven management solutions and CUBELIZER tackles this issue by deploying a network of IoT optical devices that detect and track
                            people, with no privacy issues, teaming up with our own computer vision algorithms and hardware design. Then we transform raw data into actionable information.

                            Shopping centers promote the efficiency of leasing, marketing and operations achieving a ROI over 25% by providing red flags about tenant’s performance and commercial mix
                            and minimizing tenant vacancy periods.

                            Although, CUBELIZER started at the retail sector, working at the shopping center and retail sector, which is going on being one of their main businesses, the lack of data
                            has been identified as a real problem in many, just apparently, different sectors: airports, workplaces, supermarkets, museums, etc. And CUBELIZER solution can address
                            those issues with barely any adjustments making CUBELIZER a highly powerful company. Currently, apart from the retail sector, workplaces’ one is a raising business in which
                            the company is working with top-tier companies helping them on having the information to operate and design more efficient and healthier offices. Workplaces achieve a 20%
                            higher efficiency with a 2-month payback period by knowing the occupancy, utilization rates and patterns on desks, common spaces, and meeting rooms. CUBELIZER is a key
                            collaborator for companies to have the proper KPIs to get insights to monitor people's wellbeing, productivity, and collaboration levels.

                            In response to COVID-19 breakout and to help our customer on managing the “new reality”, CUBELIZER solution has been adapted to provide information about COVID protocols
                            accomplishment in physical spaces regarding capacity, people flow directions and social distancing. This feature allows customers to identify potential inefficiencies in
                            protocol settings, communication or people behavior and act to improve the situation.

                <p class="paragraph">
                  <span style="font-weight: bold">The problem</span>: Gatherings of people in offices, classrooms and any indoor environment during the coronavirus pandemic raised significant concerns
                  about aerosols and the risk of infection as there is a considerable amount of exhaled air containing CO2. The Federal Environment Agency of
                  Germany and the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) published recommendations long before the
                  coronavirus outbreak: In classrooms and offices, the CO2 concentration should not exceed 1,000 ppm but it was only during the COVID-19 outbreak
                  that air quality monitoring has finally received the attention needed from the general public and decision makers.<br>
                  Monitoring the Indoor Air Quality is now at the core of well-being and health and returning safe to work/ school/ indoor restaurants, but acting on
                  information about the air quality is still underrated but we believe a key to staying safe and productive.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                  <span style="font-weight: bold">Our solution</span>: Our solution does not only sense the air indoors, but will also discreetly notify occupants if the quality has worsened (e.g. VOCs or
                  CO2 has built-up) and that they need to ventilate. Working and living in a fresh and healthy environment can profoundly improve performance, reduce
                  anxiety, complaints (and even headaches) and allow you to focus on doing the things you love.<br>
                  Existing air quality monitoring and CO2 monitoring solutions are complex to install, not easily scalable, often cost prohibitive and rarely include
                  a mechanism to alert the end user / tenant / occupant as data is feeding into dashboards that are visible to building management employees and
                  management.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                  We developed two easy to install LoRaWAN based Air Quality Index (AQI) and a CO2 sensor with LED notification and buzzer:<br>
                  •	The AQI sensors allows for monitoring temperature, humidity, VOC and CO2 levels as an overall index using Bosch sensing technology<br>
                  •	The CO2 sensor allows for monitoring temperature, humidity and actual CO2 in ppm<br>
                  •	Both have configurable LED (traffic light indications) and buzzer notification thresholds alerting occupants of a room when it needs ventilation
                  and is no longer a safe and productive environment.<br>
                  •	Immediate notification can be configured depending on the use case to include sound, light or a combination of both.<br>
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                  <span style="font-weight: bold">The benefits</span>:<br>
                  These are countless Ventilation is an important factor in mitigating against the risk of far-field (>2m) aerosol transmission and the idea of installing
                  CO2 -measuring devices in classrooms and offices, as well as other indoor public spaces like gyms, bars, and restaurants, is about preventing the spread
                  of the virus. The solution includes easy to install, inexpensive and compact CO2-measuring devices (either AQI or CO2), connecting them to a LoRaWAN
                  gateway and feeding the data directly to the user (by device notification), allowing for monitoring over time on the MClimate application on a phone or
                  displaying it on a tablet in the actual room of use thus warning against high concentrations of CO2 in the air and thus also against high levels of
                  aerosols. These could be used to indicate a potential increased risk of infection with coronavirus.

                            ESG is now a leading performance indicator for commercial real estate. ESG standards held by regulators and other stakeholders continue to evolve—and owners need to provide
                            more accurate, granular data on demand. They also need a scalable solution that can grow with their portfolios and evolving ESG requirements.

                            Alexander Roth is CEO of the Austrian PropTech iDWELL -  an innovative CRM Saas Software for property management companies. He studied business
                            administration at the University of Vienna, at the Financial University of Moscow and at King’s College in London.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            He gained his CRM-expertise as a business manager at the E-commerce platform “BlackFridaySale”. Due to his family background in property management
                            he realised that the industry was highly under digitalised. With the founding of iDWELL he started to solve the underlying pain points of the
                            industry - daily calls, e-mails and letters of landlords, dwellers and service providers.  iDWELL bundles all these activities on one CRM platform.
                            At the moment over 650.000 apartment units are managed via iDWELL.
