                                  allowed her to increase the awareness and impact of her research in both real estate theory and practice. She works as a post-doc researcher at Politecnico

                                  di Milano) conducts yearly since 2018 to keep track of the PropTech expansion in the country and abroad. The Monitor shows how PropTech is gaining momentum in
                                  Italy, even if with some delay compared to other European counterparts. At the same time, the Monitor demonstrates some of the strengths and weaknesses of the
                                  PropTech national ecosystem. The activities and events organized by the IPN aim at addressing the most urgent issues that are slowing down the PropTech development.
                                  However, a lot of work still needs be done, especially to internationalize the local real estate investments and operations.

                                  Since the onset of the pandemic schools and businesses have struggled to offer safe spaces for people to gather and work collectively.

                                  Ventilation is proven to be one of, if not the best measure to prevent virus transmission indoors. However, occupancy and ventilation
                                  characteristics differ in each room so it's difficult to know when to ventilate, and for how long, to keep the air safe.

                                  RYSTA Protect, our CO2 traffic light and air quality monitor, helps schools and businesses ventilate optimally to improve air quality and reduce virus
                                  transmission risk. This creates a healthy working environment fostering inner peace, better concentration and promotes a sense of community.

                                  By alerting room occupants to air quality through the CO2 traffic light, RYSTA Protect helps people to ventilate optimally. This offers several benefits:<br>
                                  •	Certainty that schools and businesses are offering safe working spaces and that they can remain open<br>
                                  • Peace of mind for room occupants so they can work and learn collectively carefree<br>
                                  •	Reduced heat loss through optimally adjusted ventilation<br>
                                  • Good indoor air promoting concentration and counteracting allergies and illnesses<br>
                              </p>

                                  Our in-house developed IoT platform features sensors, analytics and frontends. Each sensor measures CO2 concentration, temperature, humidity, noise, brightness
                                  and pressure. This data gives us transparency into our buildings and can be used to understand room occupancy, reduce mould risk, reduce energy consumption and
                                  more.

                                  Data is at the heart of what RYSTA does. Since each sensor measures 6 metrics, we can measure as many metrics and data points that are feasible for each customer.
                                  Additionally, our adaptable platform can be tailored to many use cases.

                                  RYSTA is designed to monitor entire buildings rather than covering single rooms. Customers can see data from across all their rooms through the dashboard. Data
                                  sets for learning and improving services can also be made available to third parties such as insurance and utility companies.

                                  At this stage,  schools (in Germany) are primarily using the solution - from kindergarten to secondary schools.

                                  Our customers tell us that:<br>
                                  • Teachers and pupils jointly take responsibility for when to ventilate - creating a sense of community and helping fearful kids because they don’t have to
                                  rely on the teacher who might be too busy teaching in order to pay attention all the time<br>
                                  •	RYSTA helps that there is clarity (and no arguing) for exactly how long windows need to stay open<br>
                                  • They learned that the outside weather, class size and age of the pupils matter a lot; they also learned about the importance of cross airing<br>
                                  •	The dashboard gives additional insights previously unknown (e.g. heating/cooling behaviour of a room/building throughout day/night, room occupancy)<br>
                                  • The wall-mounted traffic light sensor is discreet yet clear with only visual and no acoustic alerts for uninterrupted teaching, specifically designed for
                                  learning and working environments

                                  Adam Korbuly is the key founder of OrthoGraph. Adam is an Electrical Engineer by profession, but worked always as a software developer from the age of 12. As an
                                  employee of Graphisoft in 1998 invented ArchiFM, the first BIM CAFM and CMMS software system (at that time BIM was called Virtual Building). This system became
                                  the market leader in Hungary and is used all around the world with success. In 2005 Adam made a spin-off of the ArchiFM department and established an own company
                                  that has grown continuously since then.
                              </p>

                              <p class="paragraph">
                                  During project implementations that Adam personally participated in it became clear that one of the strongest pain points of each individual system implementation
                                  is the lack of valid building data. Neither the floor plans, nor the asset inventory are valid at typical projects, even if they exist at any level. That's what
                                  brought Adam with his friend to establish OrthoGraph as a mobile and web technology focusing on democratizing the BIM Digital Twin for facility and maintenance
                                  management services.
                              </p>

                              <p class="paragraph">
                                  Adam still participates in sales, project services, technology developments related to the project implementation to be able to effectively fulfill the growing demand
                                  for OrthoGraph's services by involving a continuously growing service and strategic development partner network.

                                  Many CAFM+CMMS projects fail before their start due to the high entry barrier of collecting digital building data and the high cost of keeping that data up to date.

                                  István University), construction companies (e.g. Futureal), production companies (e.g. in BOSCH's largest production plant) and many other modern thinking large property
                                  owners, who understand the importance of increasing the performance of building operation while reducing their related costs.

                                  / surveyor and 500-700 inventory items daily per surveyor, and this can be multiplied by the number of surveyors.

                                      Info on buildings/projects OrthoGraph operates in what kind of issues OrthoGraph solves, especially ones related to Covid-19
                                  </span><br>
                                  OrthoGraph is mainly a technology provider to support building surveying, inventory and operation services in an integration with third-party technologies. OrthoGraph
                                  directly only participates in pilot projects of system implementations, and then hands over the full projects to their local and global partners. OrthoGraph Enterprise
                                  technology has been used in several successful projects at the largest property owners, hospitals, universities, shopping malls, office houses and production facilities.
                                  At all of these projects removing the long lasting entry-barrier of reality capture by using simple and rugged tools and workflows ensured instant ROIs of all project
                                  costs for the end-users and a strong base for scaling up the results to the total properties.
                              </p>

                              <p class="paragraph">
                                  OrthoGraph technology is available worldwide either supported by the continuously growing international partner network of OrthoGraph or served directly with the strength
                                  of the company's HQ resources. OrthoGraph is looking for international partners that can provide local services related to reality capture, CAFM consultation, business
                                  process reengineering and local training services. The model is beneficial for all participants of the chain including most importantly the end-users, who can expect a 3-6
                                  times ROI for the first year of implementation, and a 15 times ROI for 3 years of system implementation and usage. This is achieved by accurate surface and inventory data
                                  for rental, refurbishment/renovation, maintenance and regular operation services of any kinds of buildings. Interestingly in the era of industrial use the BIM generated by
                                  the CAFM services can be further used to support the machinery maintenance, greatly reducing the downtimes and repair times of production equipment. This means the facility
                                  management services provide well visible value generation in the effective production performance of such companies.

                                  In response to COVID-19 OrthoGraph contains a new feature that helps planning the arrangement of offices, workplaces by graphically displaying if they are too close to
                                  each-other. This simplifies the graphical planning of the arrangements keeping social distancing, all-this on-site where the particular utilization of such arrangements should
                                  be applied.

                                      allowed her to increase the awareness and impact of her research in both real estate theory and practice. She works as a post-doc researcher at Politecnico

                                      Chiara will share the results of the Italian PropTech Monitor, a study that the Italian PropTech Network – IPN (within the Real Estate Center of Politecnico
                                      di Milano) conducts yearly since 2018 to keep track of the PropTech expansion in the country and abroad. The Monitor shows how PropTech is gaining momentum in
                                      Italy, even if with some delay compared to other European counterparts. At the same time, the Monitor demonstrates some of the strengths and weaknesses of the
                                      PropTech national ecosystem. The activities and events organized by the IPN aim at addressing the most urgent issues that are slowing down the PropTech development.
                                      However, a lot of work still needs be done, especially to internationalize the local real estate investments and operations.

                                      Since the onset of the pandemic schools and businesses have struggled to offer safe spaces for people to gather and work collectively.
                                  </p>

                                      Ventilation is proven to be one of, if not the best measure to prevent virus transmission indoors. However, occupancy and ventilation
                                      characteristics differ in each room so it's difficult to know when to ventilate, and for how long, to keep the air safe.
                                  </p>

                                  <p class="paragraph">
                                      RYSTA Protect, our CO2 traffic light and air quality monitor, helps schools and businesses ventilate optimally to improve air quality and reduce virus
                                      transmission risk. This creates a healthy working environment fostering inner peace, better concentration and promotes a sense of community.

                                  <p class="paragraph">
                                      By alerting room occupants to air quality through the CO2 traffic light, RYSTA Protect helps people to ventilate optimally. This offers several benefits:<br>
                                      •	Certainty that schools and businesses are offering safe working spaces and that they can remain open<br>
                                      • Peace of mind for room occupants so they can work and learn collectively carefree<br>
                                      •	Reduced heat loss through optimally adjusted ventilation<br>
                                      • Good indoor air promoting concentration and counteracting allergies and illnesses<br>

                                      Our in-house developed IoT platform features sensors, analytics and frontends. Each sensor measures CO2 concentration, temperature, humidity, noise, brightness
                                      and pressure. This data gives us transparency into our buildings and can be used to understand room occupancy, reduce mould risk, reduce energy consumption and
                                      more.

                                      Data is at the heart of what RYSTA does. Since each sensor measures 6 metrics, we can measure as many metrics and data points that are feasible for each customer.
                                      Additionally, our adaptable platform can be tailored to many use cases.

                                      RYSTA is designed to monitor entire buildings rather than covering single rooms. Customers can see data from across all their rooms through the dashboard. Data
                                      sets for learning and improving services can also be made available to third parties such as insurance and utility companies.

                                      At this stage,  schools (in Germany) are primarily using the solution - from kindergarten to secondary schools.

                                      Our customers tell us that:<br>
                                      • Teachers and pupils jointly take responsibility for when to ventilate - creating a sense of community and helping fearful kids because they don’t have to
                                      rely on the teacher who might be too busy teaching in order to pay attention all the time<br>
                                      •	RYSTA helps that there is clarity (and no arguing) for exactly how long windows need to stay open<br>
                                      • They learned that the outside weather, class size and age of the pupils matter a lot; they also learned about the importance of cross airing<br>
                                      •	The dashboard gives additional insights previously unknown (e.g. heating/cooling behaviour of a room/building throughout day/night, room occupancy)<br>
                                      • The wall-mounted traffic light sensor is discreet yet clear with only visual and no acoustic alerts for uninterrupted teaching, specifically designed for
                                      learning and working environments

                                      Adam Korbuly is the key founder of OrthoGraph. Adam is an Electrical Engineer by profession, but worked always as a software developer from the age of 12. As an
                                      employee of Graphisoft in 1998 invented ArchiFM, the first BIM CAFM and CMMS software system (at that time BIM was called Virtual Building). This system became
                                      the market leader in Hungary and is used all around the world with success. In 2005 Adam made a spin-off of the ArchiFM department and established an own company
                                      that has grown continuously since then.

                                      During project implementations that Adam personally participated in it became clear that one of the strongest pain points of each individual system implementation
                                      is the lack of valid building data. Neither the floor plans, nor the asset inventory are valid at typical projects, even if they exist at any level. That's what
                                      brought Adam with his friend to establish OrthoGraph as a mobile and web technology focusing on democratizing the BIM Digital Twin for facility and maintenance
                                      management services.

                                      for OrthoGraph's services by involving a continuously growing service and strategic development partner network.

                                      OrthoGraph is mainly a technology provider to support building surveying, inventory and operation services in an integration with third-party technologies. OrthoGraph
                                      directly only participates in pilot projects of system implementations, and then hands over the full projects to their local and global partners. OrthoGraph Enterprise
                                      technology has been used in several successful projects at the largest property owners, hospitals, universities, shopping malls, office houses and production facilities.
                                      At all of these projects removing the long lasting entry-barrier of reality capture by using simple and rugged tools and workflows ensured instant ROIs of all project
                                      costs for the end-users and a strong base for scaling up the results to the total properties.

                                      OrthoGraph technology is available worldwide either supported by the continuously growing international partner network of OrthoGraph or served directly with the strength
                                      of the company's HQ resources. OrthoGraph is looking for international partners that can provide local services related to reality capture, CAFM consultation, business
                                      process reengineering and local training services. The model is beneficial for all participants of the chain including most importantly the end-users, who can expect a 3-6
                                      times ROI for the first year of implementation, and a 15 times ROI for 3 years of system implementation and usage. This is achieved by accurate surface and inventory data
                                      for rental, refurbishment/renovation, maintenance and regular operation services of any kinds of buildings. Interestingly in the era of industrial use the BIM generated by
                                      the CAFM services can be further used to support the machinery maintenance, greatly reducing the downtimes and repair times of production equipment. This means the facility
                                      management services provide well visible value generation in the effective production performance of such companies.

                                      Celso Masid is co-CEO and founder of CUBELIZER. Celso has a Civil Engineer background. He worked for years in that sector, designing large projects, and managing
                                      multidisciplinary and international teams. He worked as innovation consultant and leading new business units from 2011 until 2016, when Cubelizer was born. At
                                      CUBELIZER, he is leading the business side and general management of the company.

                                      As customers and users of retail stores and shopping centers, Marcos and Celso, wondered how these spaces were being managed. A great gap was identified, and a lack
                                      of data to manage them in a more efficient way. While analytics were a key tool in the digital world, physical world, and specifically in the retail sector, lacked,
                                      and still did, accurate, consistent, and reliable data about space people behavior. Even more, a rising concern about privacy became a stone on the road for many
                                      solutions without a clear path to solve it. So, CUBELIZER was born to provide physical assets the tool they needed to manage spaces in an actual informed way.

                                      CUBELIZER was born in 2016 from the vision of creating a new era of highly efficient management of physical assets by providing actual and real time information
                                      about how spaces are really used while respecting people's privacy. We aim to automate and make easy getting information about how spaces perform.

                                  <p class="paragraph">
                                      CUBELIZER helps physical space managers and designers, especially shopping centers and workplaces, understand the use of the space to improve design and operation,
                                      getting higher efficiency and revenues and savings. We use accurate and consistent information gathered in an anonymous way from our in-house developed real time image

                                      Physical spaces are in urgent need of data-driven management solutions and CUBELIZER tackles this issue by deploying a network of IoT optical devices that detect and track
                                      people, with no privacy issues, teaming up with our own computer vision algorithms and hardware design. Then we transform raw data into actionable information.

                                      Shopping centers promote the efficiency of leasing, marketing and operations achieving a ROI over 25% by providing red flags about tenant’s performance and commercial mix
                                      and minimizing tenant vacancy periods.

                                      Although, CUBELIZER started at the retail sector, working at the shopping center and retail sector, which is going on being one of their main businesses, the lack of data
                                      has been identified as a real problem in many, just apparently, different sectors: airports, workplaces, supermarkets, museums, etc. And CUBELIZER solution can address
                                      those issues with barely any adjustments making CUBELIZER a highly powerful company. Currently, apart from the retail sector, workplaces’ one is a raising business in which
                                      the company is working with top-tier companies helping them on having the information to operate and design more efficient and healthier offices. Workplaces achieve a 20%
                                      higher efficiency with a 2-month payback period by knowing the occupancy, utilization rates and patterns on desks, common spaces, and meeting rooms. CUBELIZER is a key
                                      collaborator for companies to have the proper KPIs to get insights to monitor people's wellbeing, productivity, and collaboration levels.

                                      In response to COVID-19 breakout and to help our customer on managing the “new reality”, CUBELIZER solution has been adapted to provide information about COVID protocols
                                      accomplishment in physical spaces regarding capacity, people flow directions and social distancing. This feature allows customers to identify potential inefficiencies in

                      <b>The reason to undertake making these maps is very simple:</b> when we tried to figure out how Eastern Europe is being positioned on
                      international level in PropTech, we found no information in one place which explicitly and clearly displays the big picture, particularly
                      the number of PropTech companies in different geographical regions; which are the most dominant continents in PropTech (based on nr of
                      generated tech solutions); how different European regions differ when compared to each other, and most importantly what the position of
                      Eastern Europe is.

                      McKinsey (2021) in their report ‘Europe’s innovation wunderkinds: The rising B2B start-up ecosystem’ state as follows, ‘Comparing different
                      regions in Europe, we observe that the funding efficiency (revenue per total amount of funding) is indeed higher in regions of Eastern and
                      Southern European countries, where funding is least abundant (Exhibit 2). By contrast, the largest European start-up ecosystems in Germany
                      and France have the lowest revenue-per-funding ratios in Europe; nevertheless, they still generate about 1.5 times more revenue per dollar
                      invested than B2B start-ups in the United States’. Eastern EU capital efficiency of B2B startups is 5.6x higher than the one of US B2B
                      startups. Actually, the highest in Europe.

                      On September 23, 2021 the World Intellectual Property Organization released the 14th edition of Global Innovation Index 2021 Report.
                      <br>
                      This global report ranks 132 countries along 21 categories and 81 subcategories, such as: Business Sophistication, Knowledge and Technology Outputs, Infrastruction,
                      Market Sophistication, etc.
                      <br>
                      The report exhibits precise ranking of all Central & South-East European countries along all categories and subcategories. However, our team inquired how CSEE countries
                      stand compared to Western economies. This is why we traced all parameters and generated the 2 continua you can see here.
